1) Creates a .get directory
2) Dont really know how to explain it, dont wanna think about it
3) U go adding and adding til u see that the next thing that u modificated does't go in the same logical change :D
4) With names its easier to remember what diference its between one version and the other
5) Mergin by git it's easier and faster, but doing it manually allows u to decide exactly what to do
